## Build a DF Summarizing Coverage
```{r}

                       num_spotted_facilities = integer(),
                       coverage = double())

spotted <- c()

for (year in as.integer(format(min_date, "%Y")):as.integer(format(max_date, "%Y"))) {
  year_date <- as.Date(paste(year, "-01-01", sep = ""))
  
  # extant facilities
  fac_exist <- facs %>%
    filter(start_date <= year_date) %>%
    distinct(facility_name)  # Get unique facility names
  
  n_fac_exist <- nrow(fac_exist)
  
  # spotted facilities
  fac_spotted <- res %>%
    filter(Acquisitio <= year_date) %>%
    distinct(facility_name)  # Get unique facility names
  
  spotted <- unique(append(spotted,fac_spotted$facility_name))
  
  res <- res %>% 
    filter(Acquisitio > year_date)
  # 
  n_fac_spotted <- length(spotted)
  # 
  coverage <- bind_rows(coverage, data.frame(year = year,
                                             num_extant_facilities = n_fac_exist,

## Plot Coverage
```{r}

  labs(y = "Coverage", 
       x = "Year",
       fill = "") +
  theme_minimal()
```


```{r}
# replace NA start dates with 1900

# filter out captures that occured before construction or after end date
captures <- captures %>% filter(start_date <= Acquisitio)
```

```{r}
length(unique(result1$facility_name))
length(unique(captures1$facility_name))

```


```{r}
